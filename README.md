## About

This plugin will generate meta content for your Content Security Policy tag and input the correct data into your HTML template, generated by [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/jantimon/html-webpack-plugin/).

All inline JS and CSS will be hashed, including all entry and async chunks, and inserted into the policy.


## Installation

Install the plugin with npm:
```
npm i --save-dev csp-html-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

In the plugins section of your webpack config file, include the following:

```
new HtmlWebpackPlugin({ ... })
new CspHtmlWebpackPlugin({ ... }, { ... })
```

where `{ ... }` are config options filled for both plugins

Finally, add the following tag to your HTML template where you would like to add the CSP policy:
```
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="%%CSP_POLICY%%">
```

## Configuration

This plugin accepts 2 params with the following structure:
* {object} Policy (optional) - a flat object which defines your CSP policy. Valid keys and values can be found on the [MDN CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) page. Values can either be a string or an array of strings.
* {object} Additional Options (optional) - a flat object with the optional configuration options:
  * {string} hashingMethod - accepts 'sha256', 'sha384', 'sha512' - your node version must also accept this hashing method.

#### Default Policy:

```
{
  'base-uri': "'self'",
  'object-src': "'none'",
  'script-src': ["'unsafe-inline'", "'self'", "'unsafe-eval'"],
  'style-src': ["'unsafe-inline'", "'self'", "'unsafe-eval'"]
};
```

#### Default Additional Options:

```
{
  hashingMethod: 'sha256'
}
